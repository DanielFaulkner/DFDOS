PrintMsg Int - Works ok
ProgramTerminate Int's - Works (But special functions which pass values onto the OS are not implemented)

All other interrupts have not been properly tested.
They will be tested as utilites/drivers/applications which need them are developed.

Only a certain number of interrupts are working currently.
Most of the current interrupt functions are for stdio style stuff.

For a complete list either look at the source or request a list of
functions which are currently implemented.

If you try to run an un-implemented function the program will not
halt but you will not get any output from the interrupt call.
This should allow some programs to continue running dispite that
function is not working. (Depends on application error handling)

Note - A number of graphics demo's will work currently. To find
