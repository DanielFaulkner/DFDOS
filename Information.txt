Readme file for version 0.04a of DF-DOS

Bootloader - Ver 0.5 (FAT12)
Kernel - Ver 0.04a
Installer - N/A (Some DOS batch files)

Once loaded type 'help' at the DF-DOS prompt for a list of commands.

Installation:
I hope to start on an installer soon, however unfortunatly at this stage
I have yet to start work on one.
There are some batch (.bat) files around in some directory's to help you
with some parts of the compile and install process.
Also there are half built .sh files and make files for the compile/
install process in linux.  But those have not been tested and are
unlikely to work initially in this version (I will improve them at a
later date)

Until that then however I have included in each directory an Install.txt
file which should document how to get to the next stage.

If you are new to this and just want to see it work please look in the
compiled directorys.

If you change the code I image you know how to compile/install it.
However I have installation instructions for use from the source stage.

The instructions included are for installing to the floppy disk.
Once installed reboot with the floppy disk in the drive.
And assuming that the BIOS is set to first boot from the floppy drive
it should boot up DF-DOS (if not check the BIOS documentation)
If it fails to work please re-read this documentation and follow the 
instructions carefully before getting in contact.
