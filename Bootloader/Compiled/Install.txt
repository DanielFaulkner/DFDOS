Bootloader Installation Instructions
(This is customised for version 0.5 of the bootloader)

I will assume that you know DOS/Linux enough to understand the examples.
However I will try to make it easy for you to understand.

Copying the compiled files to the floppy disk/image:

DOS:
(Requires debug, which comes as default normally)
(Make sure a blank floppy disk is in the drive)
Type:

c:\bootloader\compiled> debug Ownbl5s1
- w 100 0 0 1
- q

c:\bootloader\compiled> debug Ownbl5s2
- w 100 0 1 3
- q

For extra help from debug type:
- ?
...
- q

*** Important - on many OS's (windows esp) you may well find that
you have to force the OS to re-read the floppy FAT table so it won't
over write the bootloader with files. This is best done by a reboot
or by inserting and reading another disk then re-inserting/reading
the floppy with the bootloader.
*** Warning - Debug or similar programs can, if used badly, seriously
damage your drives please follow the instructions carefully and
if unsure check the documentation or ask for help.

Linux:
(Requires dd, which comes as default in most distrobutions)
(There is no need to mount the floppy disk before typing the commands,
I recommend typeing the commands with the floppy disk un mounted,
but you will require a blank floppy disk in the drive)
Type:
~/bootloader/compiled> dd if=Ownbl5s1 bs=512 of=/dev/fd0

~/bootloader/compiled> dd if=Ownbl5s1 bs=512 seek=1 of=/dev/fd0

If this does not work please check the man page/documentation.
Try typing: 'man dd'
This will give you an idea of the command line options.

(This WILL destroy any data on the floppy disk so please remember to 
use a blank disk or a disk containing no important data, the filesystem
it is formatted in doesn't matter at this stage)

The resulting floppy should with some luck be FAT12 compatable.
