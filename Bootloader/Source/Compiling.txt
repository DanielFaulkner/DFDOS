Bootloader Manual Install Instructions
(Customised for version 0.5)

I assume that the reader will know at least the basics of DOS/Linux and
can work out the meaning of the instructions.

To compile:
(You will require the NASM compiler, unless you are willing to re-write
the source for an alternative compiler)

DOS:
Type:
c:\bootloader\source> nasm ownbl5s1.asm

c:\bootloader\source> nasm ownbl5s2.asm

This will output: ownbl5s1 and ownbl5s2
If you want to check to size type 'dir' to confirm the size of ownbl5s1 to be 512 bytes.

Linux:
Type:
~/bootloader/source> nasm ownbl5s1.asm

~/bootloader/source> nasm ownbl5s2.asm

This will output: ownbl5s1 and ownbl5s2
If you want to check the size type 'ls -l' to confirm the size of ownbl4s1 to be 512 bytes.

If for some reason the instructions above do not work please consult the 
documentation which came with your version of the NASM x86 compiler.
(This was written and tested with NASM version 0.98 & 0.98.38)

Or for linux type: 'man nasm'
This should display the correct command prompt options.
