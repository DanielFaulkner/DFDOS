If you have a DOS type system and want to take a short cut you can
use the batch files in this directory - May not work on all computers
so be prepared to follow the instructions in the source directory.

Type:
...\Ver003\Bootloader> Compile

This will compile the boot loader source files.
You MUST have nasm in your path for this to work. (Check by typing
nasm at the DOS prompt, if it works thats fine. Also keep the
same directory structure as it was zipped in)

Currently I am afraid the installation to the floppy drive has no
installer what so ever.
Linux make files and .sh files will come in later versions,
along with a graphical install program.
