Boot Loader 0.5 Readme:

Installation instructions:
Each directory should contain instructions on installing/making the
boot loader to the next stage.
(Eg Source -> Compiled)

The instructions included are for installing to the floppy disk.
Once installed reboot with the floppy disk in the drive.
And assuming that the BIOS is set to first boot from the floppy drive
it should boot up (if not check the BIOS documentation)
If it fails to work please re-read this documentation and follow the 
instructions carefully before getting in contact.
