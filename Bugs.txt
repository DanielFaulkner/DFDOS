All current bugs are to do with the console which will soon be fixed.
I hope to move the console out of the kernel eventually.
Failing that at least re-write it using the interrupt handler for some stuff.

Known bugs:
The arrow keys won't move the cursor in the console.
The OS is almost all case sensitive.
- (Commands - All lower case, Files - This varies depending on the case you save it in)
Some interrupts only partially work or may not work at all. Expect some applications
to not work, certainly if they use file related interrupts.

You MUST force the OS in the installation procedure to re-read the floppy before copying
the kernel or any other file onto the floppy disk containing the bootloader.

Recently fixed bugs:
Clear screen puts 4 0's at the top of the screen.
The commands will work if only half entered.
The backspace button DOES work but there is no evidence on the screen.
If you backspace back to much the console will freeze.
