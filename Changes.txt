Ver 0.04a Contains a more advanced read-only FAT12 driver. Other
touchups have been made else where in the program also. 'ls'
command now present (in DOS that would be 'dir', will duplicate
with DOS terminology later).

Ver 0.03 Contains a simple FAT12 driver. It can read files and run
very simple DOS binary files. Also the console has been improved.

Ver 0.02 contains a functional (though not perfected) interrupt
handler and functions. (trying to be DOS compatable)

Note: Not all interrupts functions have been made (by a long way)
