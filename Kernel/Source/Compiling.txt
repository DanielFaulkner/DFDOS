DF-DOS kernel install instructions
(Customised for Version 0.04)

Files that should be included in the source directory:
kernel.asm, data.inc, txtio.inc, console.inc, commands.inc, intrupt.inc,
IntFuncs.inc, int20.inc, int21.inc, int22.inc, int23.inc, int24.inc,
int25.inc, int26.inc, int27.inc, int28.inc, int29.inc, int2e.inc,
int2f.inc, HWtests.inc, convers.inc, FAT12drv.inc, FAT12Wdrv.inc

If any of those are missing it is likly that the compile will fail.
A detailed note on what each file contains will be made later or when
there is enough demand for it.

Compile:

DOS:
(Requires NASM 16bit DOS version)
C:\kernel\source> nasm kernel.asm -o KERNEL.COM

Outputs kernel as KERNEL.COM in this directory

Linux:
(Requires NASM)
c:\kernel\source> nasm kernel.asm -o KERNEL.COM

Should output kernel as KERNEL.COM in this directory

If this varies or you have any problem please consult the documentation
which came with your version of the NASM x86 compiler.

It has been tested using NASM version 0.98 & 0.98.38
