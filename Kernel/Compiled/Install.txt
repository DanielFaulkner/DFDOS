DF-DOS Installation Instructions
(Customised for version 0.04)

Make sure to have the floppy disk containing the bootloader in the
floppy drive, and that the OS has re-read the FAT table on the floppy
disk by means of removing the disk reading another disk and
re-inserting the disk containing the bootloader.
Then copy the resulting file to the floppy disk.

DOS:
Type:

c:\kernel\compiled> copy KERNEL.COM a:\KERNEL.COM

For help please consult the DOS documentation

Linux:
(Make sure the floppy disk is mounted)
Type:

~/kernel/compiled> cp KERNEL.COM /floppy/KERNEL.COM

For help please consult the linux documentation.

Once you have got to this stage and the floppy disk contains the boot sector
and the kernel you are ready to reboot and try out the DF-DOS floppy.

I will not pretend that this is usefull. But it may help those interested
in OS development. And it proves that this project does mean business.
Not an other idea only project.
