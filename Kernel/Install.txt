If you have a DOS system you can use the Batch files here to do the
work for you. However it may not work on all computers so be prepared
to install following the instructions manually. You must keep the
zipped files directory structure for this to work.

Type at the prompt: (Optional as compiled file pre-existing)
...\Ver004\Kernel> Compile

This will make the source into a compiled kernel and store the image
in the compiled directory.
However to do this you MUST have nasm (DOS 16bit version) in your path.
To check nasm is in the path try typing nasm at a DOS prompt and
checking nasm does start (even in directorys without the nasm file).
(Later versions may come with a small NASM compiler included)

Type at the prompt:
...\Ver004\Kernel> Install

This will copy the kernel image to a floppy disk so allowing you to
try the operating system.
However the floppy disc MUST all ready have the boot loader written
to it.

If you have Linux make files and .sh files will be created at a later
date.
Also a graphical install program may be put together at a later date.
